        <h2>Stand holding a barbell with your palms facing up. Bend your knees slightly and lean forward by bending at the waist. 
            Keeping your back straight, and elbows close to your body, row the barbell towards your chest, squeezing your back muscles. 
            Slowly lower to the starting position. The bent-over row, also known as the barbell row and the barbell bent-over row, is a compound exercise that activates muscles throughout your upper and lower body. 
            Perform bent-over rows by hinging your hips and leaning forward to lift a weighted barbell toward your body with a rowing movement pattern.</h2>

        <h1><p style= color:mediumblue>BARBELL ROW BENEFITS:</p></h1>
        <h2>The barbell row is an excellent exercise for building up your back muscles. More specifically, you'll work your mid- and upper-back muscles, like the lats, rhomboids, traps, and rear delts. 
            Your rotator cuffs and other shoulder stabilizers are also involved, making it a solid movement for "bulletproofing" your shoulders, according to Samuel. Thanks to the bent-over position, however, you'll also have to get your glutes and core engaged more than you might expect. 
            Finally, if you use the underhand grip Samuel suggests, you'll challenge your biceps, brachialis, and forearms too, making the barbell row a low-key asset on arm day as well.</h2>

        <h1><p style= color:mediumblue>HOW TO DO BARBELL ROW:</p></h1>
        <h2>●Load up a barbell with plates, then approach it as you would a deadlift: stand with your feet about hip-width apart, 
            then push your butt back and hinge at the hips to bend over and grasp the bar.
        </br>
        </br>
            ●Take an underhand grip when you grasp the bar. 
            This will allow you to involve your biceps more in the pulling movement and help to prevent an internally-rotated position.
        </br>
        </br>
            ●Keep your head in a neutral position, looking down at the ground. 
            This helps to prevent your lower back from going into extension.
        </br>
        </br>
            ●Squeeze your glutes and core to create tension. Raise your torso slightly to raise the weight off the floor.
        </br>
        </br>
            ●Move at the elbow and shoulder to row the bar to the top of your ribcage. 
            Aim to 'break' the bar against your chest, pausing in the top position if you can.
        </br>
        </br>
            ●Control the weight back down to the starting position, maintaining your posture.</h2>
