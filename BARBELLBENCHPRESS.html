        </br>
            2. Lie flat on your back on a bench with your feet planted on the floor.
        </br>
            3. Grip the barbell with an overhand grip, between 1-1.5 times wider than your shoulders. 
        </br>
            4. Take a deep breath in and hold it while removing the barbell from the rack. Lower it from over the shoulder joint down until it lightly grazes the chest.
        </br>
            5. Press forcefully off your chest and extend your arms. The barbell should return to directly over the shoulder joint after each rep.</h2>
